                <h2 class="abtustitle2">Welcome to Our Phone List Project</h2>
                <p>This website is a class project created for our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript course at Handassaim Technion. Our
                    goal is to build an interactive and user-friendly phone list application that helps users manage their
                    contacts efficiently. From adding and editing contacts to searching, sorting, and tagging them—this project
                    is designed with both functionality and clean design in mind.</p>

                <p>We are Jobran Ayash and Majd Bathesh, two students passionate about web development and software design.
                    Through this project, we’re applying our skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to solve a practical challenge
                    while learning real-world programming techniques and best practices.</p>

                <h3 class="abtustitle3">Project Overview</h3>
                <p>Our phone list application allows users to create, edit, delete, and search through their contacts. It
                    includes features such as image uploads, tags, favorites, responsive design, and pop-up forms. We've
                    structured our code for clarity and maintainability and used event delegation to manage dynamic elements
                    effectively.</p>
